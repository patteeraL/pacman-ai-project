# pacman-ai-project
This project simulates the Pacman game, offering two algorithms to control Pacman: Minimax or Genetic Algorithm (GA). Pacman navigates a grid to collect coins while avoiding the ghost, which minimizes Pacmanâ€™s score. The goal is to maximize the score through coin collection, bonus points, and hidden points over multiple rounds.
